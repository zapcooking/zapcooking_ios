///
/// Only deletions from the event's own author are honoured (NIP-09
/// requirement); a third party can't delete someone else's note.

/// Callers are on the MainActor (`FeedViewModel`, `ProfileViewModel`,
/// `SearchViewModel`, `ThreadViewModel`), so nothing here may block: ingest
/// only touches memory under the lock, and the UserDefaults write is
/// debounced onto `saveQueue`. See `scheduleSave`.
