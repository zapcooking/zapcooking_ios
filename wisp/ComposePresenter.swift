import SwiftUI

/// App-level router for the keyboard-raising sheets (reply / quote / emoji
/// reaction composers, and the zap sheet) triggered from a `PostCardView`
/// action bar.
///
/// **Why this exists.** `PostCardView` lives inside a feed `LazyVStack`. When a
/// composer is presented from the card's own `.sheet(item:)` and `ComposeView`
/// raises the keyboard, the keyboard's safe-area inset shrinks the feed, the
/// `LazyVStack` re-windows its rows, and the presenting row's `.sheet` modifier
/// is torn down on the recycle — but the card's `@State` survives (it's keyed to
/// the stable `ForEach` identity), so SwiftUI immediately re-presents. That
/// re-raises the keyboard, and the sheet flips open/closed in a loop until the
/// app is force-quit. See `PostCardView`'s comments and
/// `docs/MODAL_PRESENTATION_FROM_SWIFTUI_SHEETS.md`.
///
/// The cure is to host these sheets from a view that is **never** inside a lazy
/// container and **never** recycled. A single `ComposePresenter` is injected
/// into the environment at `MainView`'s root ZStack; any card in any tab reads
/// it and routes its composer there, so the actual `.sheet` lives on the stable
/// app root rather than on the recyclable row.
