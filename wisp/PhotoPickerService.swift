/// Imperative photo picker. Replaces the SwiftUI `UIViewControllerRepresentable`
/// + `.background()` host approach that was unreliable on iPhone 13 Pro
/// Max — modals presented from a bare host inside a SwiftUI sheet were
/// torn down silently within ~1s of appearing.
///
/// Call `PhotoPickerService.present(...)` from any button action. The
/// service walks up to the topmost presented view controller and asks
/// it to present the picker, so the picker lives in the same
/// presentation chain as the compose sheet itself — no extra host, no
/// representable lifecycle interactions.
///
/// **Important.** Other `UIViewControllerRepresentable`s in the same
/// sheet that call `host.presentedViewController?.dismiss(animated:)`
/// in their `else` branch MUST guard on the controller type — see
/// `docs/MODAL_PRESENTATION_FROM_SWIFTUI_SHEETS.md` for the rationale.
/// Failing to guard caused the very issue this service was rebuilt to
/// fix.
