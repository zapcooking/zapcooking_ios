# Zap Cooking

A food-first iOS client for [Nostr](https://nostr.com) — recipes, cooking, and the foodstr community, built natively with SwiftUI. Zap Cooking is a fork of [Wisp](https://github.com/barrydeen/wisp-ios) (MIT, © Barry Deen); it inherits Wisp's production Nostr plumbing and layers a food experience on top.

> **Status:** in-progress fork. The Nostr foundation — Spark wallet, NIP-57 zaps, NIP-17 DMs, NIP-65 outbox routing, NIP-42 AUTH, on-device spam filtering, ObjectBox cache, Apple iCloud Keychain recovery — is inherited from Wisp and ships as-is. The food layer (recipes, Sous Chef, Nourish, Cheffy, OnlyFood) is under active development. See [`ZAPCOOKING_IOS_BUILD.md`](ZAPCOOKING_IOS_BUILD.md) (the system of record) and [`PORT_ROADMAP.md`](PORT_ROADMAP.md) (living status).

## Why Zap Cooking

Zap Cooking puts food first. It inherits Wisp's full outbox/inbox relay model with reliability scoring — routing messages based on where users actually publish and read, so decentralization is the default path, not an opt-in — and focuses it on cooking: recipes as kind-30023 long-form posts, a food-tag social feed (foodstr), AI recipe import (Sous Chef), nutrition scoring (Nourish), and a kitchen companion (Cheffy).

The result is faster event delivery, less wasted bandwidth, and a client that actively reinforces the architecture Nostr was designed for — built natively for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Vision Pro from a single Swift codebase.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Outbox/Inbox Relay Routing

Wisp implements a full NIP-65 outbox/inbox model with relay scoring:

- **Outbox reads** — fetches a user's posts from their *write relays* (where they actually publish), not from a hardcoded list
- **Inbox writes** — delivers replies, reactions, and DMs to the recipient's *read relays* so they actually see them
- **Relay scoring** — `RelayScoreBoard` ranks relays by author coverage and picks the smallest useful set for each query (top-20 by default for the home feed)
- **Two-pool model** — `RelayPool` opens fresh sockets per query for one-shot reads (feeds, profiles, threads), while `GroupRelayPool` keeps long-lived sockets for groups and other persistent subscriptions, with auto-reconnect, refcounted relay usage, and inline frame demultiplexing
- **NIP-42 authentication** — handles relay AUTH challenges automatically and supports `auth-required` retries on publish, used by groups, DMs, and the scheduler relay
- **Indexer-vs-content separation** — discovery queries (kinds 0/3/10002) hit a small set of indexer relays; content queries follow each author's own outbox

### Privacy & Private Messaging

- **NIP-17 gift-wrap DMs** — three-layer privacy model (rumor → seal → gift wrap) with timestamp randomization and optional NIP-13 PoW on the wrap
- **NIP-44 v2 encryption** — ECDH (raw x-coordinate) + HKDF + ChaCha20 + HMAC-SHA256, with variable-length padding and conversation-key caching
- **Dedicated DM inbox relays** — receive DMs on your kind-10050 relay set when set, with NIP-65 fallback
- **Group DMs** — multi-recipient gift-wrapped chats by including all participants as `p` tags on the rumor
- **Anti-impersonation** — seal author is matched against rumor author on every received message
- **NIP-04 only as legacy fallback** — used solely for NIP-47 wallet services that don't yet advertise `nip44_v2`

### Lightning & Zaps

A built-in non-custodial Lightning wallet powered by [Breez SDK (Spark)](https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk-spark), plus NWC as an alternative:

- **Embedded Spark wallet** — self-custodial Lightning that runs on-device
- **12-word seed backup** — standard BIP-39 mnemonic recovery
- **Encrypted relay backup** — wallet credentials encrypted to your own pubkey (NIP-44) and published as a NIP-78 app-data event (kind 30078) so you can restore from any session; format-compatible with the Android Wisp client and other Spark wallets
- **NWC (NIP-47)** — connect any `nostr+walletconnect://` compatible wallet as an alternative
- **Zaps** — send (NIP-57), display zap receipts on the feed, and vote in **zap polls** (NIP-69)
- **Transaction history** with counterparty resolution from zap receipts
- **Fiat conversion** — sats ⇄ fiat display with cached exchange rates
- **QR scanning** for invoices and addresses

### Safety & Content Filtering

- **nspam ML classifier** — on-device LightGBM spam model with MurmurHash3 feature hashing; filters out low-quality content without sending anything off-device
- **Social graph filtering** — optional Web-of-Trust scope built from an on-device social graph database (per-account SQLite), restricting feeds to "follows + follows-of-follows" with ≥10 mutual followers
- **Mute lists** (NIP-51 kind 10000) for blocking pubkeys, words, and threads — encrypted with NIP-44 and synced via Nostr
- All safety lists sync across clients via published Nostr events

### Rich Content Types

- **Notes** — NIP-01 short text notes with full inline rendering
- **Picture posts** (NIP-68, kind 20) and **video posts** (NIP-71, kinds 21/22) with NIP-92 imeta parsing, blurhash, and thumbnails
- **Live streams** (NIP-53, kind 30311) — watch and chat on live activities
- **Polls** (NIP-88, kinds 1068/1018) — create and vote on single- or multiple-choice polls
- **Reposts** (NIP-18) with attribution
- **Emoji reactions** (NIP-25) with **custom emoji packs** (NIP-30)
- **Reply threading** (NIP-10) with root resolution and marked e-tags
- **Drafts** (NIP-37, kind 31234) — save unfinished posts encrypted to yourself and synced through your relays so they follow you across devices
- **Scheduled posts** — publish in the future via a dedicated NIP-42-authenticated scheduler relay
- **Proof-of-work** (NIP-13) — optional PoW mining with configurable difficulty and cooperative cancellation

### Groups & Communities

- **NIP-29 relay-based groups** — join, browse, chat (kind 9), with metadata and member events
- **Group persistence** — joined groups and recent messages are cached locally in a dedicated ObjectBox store, scoped by `(ownerPubkey, relayUrl, groupId)` since NIP-29 groups are relay-scoped by design
- **Persistent group sockets** — `GroupRelayPool` keeps connections open with auto-reconnect, NIP-42 AUTH, and refcounted relay teardown
- **AUTH-gated publishes** — group joins, creates, and admin operations wait for NIP-42 AUTH and retry on `auth-required`

### Media & Storage

- **Blossom** — upload images and media to decentralized [Blossom](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom) servers
- Per-account Blossom server list (kind 10063), edited in app
- Multi-server fallback — tries each configured server until one succeeds
- **Giphy** — built-in GIF picker; selected GIFs are re-hosted to your Blossom servers, with the original Giphy URL as a fallback

### Performance

- **Selective on-device persistence** — ObjectBox stores only the kinds worth keeping warm (notes, reposts, picture posts, reactions, zap receipts) for fast cold-start; everything else stays in RAM
- **In-memory caches** for profiles, emoji images, link previews, and quoted notes
- **Off-main-thread work** — relay I/O, NIP-44 crypto, ML inference, and PoW mining all run on background tasks with cancellation support
- **Lockless safety filter** — `SafetyFilter` reads a single snapshot per check and runs Set lookups; spam scoring is cached per pubkey
- **EOSE-driven query completion** — relay queries return as soon as any relay sends EOSE (with a short grace window for stragglers) rather than waiting for a fixed timeout
- **Atomic dedup** — events and gift-wraps are deduped by id across relays inside dedicated actors

### Identity, Keys & Accounts

- **Multiple accounts** with per-account state, settings, follows, and relay scoreboard
- **iOS Keychain** for the keypair (`WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`) — `nsec` never lives in `UserDefaults`
- **NIP-19 bech32** — npub, nsec, note, nevent, nprofile encode/decode, with `nostr:` URI rendering in post content
- **NIP-05 DNS verification** with result caching
- **BIP-39** mnemonic support for wallet recovery
- **QR code display** for sharing keys and profiles

### Additional Features

- **Food-first tab navigation** with declarative routing per tab — Recipes, Only Food, Search, My Kitchen, Notifications (Wallet and Messages live in the sidebar drawer; the general Nostr feed is a drawer destination)
- **Sidebar drawer** for account switching, settings, and quick navigation
- **Thread view** with NIP-10 root/reply resolution
- **Notifications** aggregating mentions, reactions, zaps, and reposts
- **Hashtag feeds** and **hashtag sets** (NIP-51 interest sets, kind 30015)
- **Follow sets** (kind 30000) and **note lists** (kind 30003) as alternative feed sources
- **Search** for profiles, content, and hashtags
- **Trending feed** for discovery
- **Social graph visualization** of your follow network
- **Profile editing** with metadata publishing
- **Onboarding flow** — key creation/import, outbox-relay discovery, and follow ingestion for new users
- **Five built-in themes** (Custom, Nord, Dracula, Gruvbox, Monochrome) with light/dark variants and a customizable accent color
- **Native iPad and Vision Pro** support — the same SwiftUI codebase ships across all three platforms

### Key Design Decisions

- **Mostly in-memory, selectively persistent** — most state lives in actor-backed in-memory caches; ObjectBox persists a narrow set of kinds (notes, reposts, picture posts, reactions, zap receipts, profiles) for fast cold-start, plus a separate ObjectBox store for joined groups and group messages. Per-account preferences live in `UserDefaults`; private keys live in the iOS Keychain.
- **Two relay pools, two lifecycles** — `RelayPool.query` is fire-and-collect for feeds and lookups; `GroupRelayPool` keeps persistent sockets with NIP-42 AUTH for groups and live subscriptions. Treat them as different tools, not interchangeable.
- **NIP files** — each NIP is implemented in `NipXX.swift` as a small set of static helpers (e.g. `Nip17.createGiftWrap()`, `Nip44.encrypt()`), making the protocol layer modular and easy to test.
- **Observation, not Combine** — view models are `@Observable @MainActor final class`; storage and shared collectors are Swift `actor`s. `NostrEvent` is a value type with a `nonisolated init` so events can cross actor boundaries freely.
- **Off-main-thread crypto** — Schnorr signing, NIP-44 encryption, ML inference, and PoW mining run on detached tasks with cancellation support.
- **Keychain for keys** — the keypair is stored as a `WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` Keychain item under service `com.wisp.nostr`; wallet seeds get their own Keychain item.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- iOS 18.0 / iPadOS 18.0 / visionOS 26.4 or later
- A Nostr keypair (generate one in-app, or import an existing `nsec`)

### Installation

TestFlight and App Store availability will be announced on the [Releases](../../releases) page.

### First Launch

1. **Create or import a key** — generate a fresh keypair or paste your `nsec`
2. **Onboarding fans out** — Wisp queries indexer relays for your kind-3 follows and their kind-10002 relay lists, then builds a relay scoreboard
3. **Pick interests / follow suggestions** — seed your first follows if you're new
4. **Start reading** — your home feed is built from the top-scored relays where the people you follow actually publish

---

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode 26 or later
- An Apple Developer account if you want to run on a physical device
- (Optional) Breez Spark API key for Lightning wallet features
- (Optional) Giphy SDK API key for the GIF picker

### Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zapcooking/zapcooking_ios.git
cd zapcooking_ios

# Open in Xcode
open wisp.xcodeproj
```

Or build from the command line:

```bash
xcodebuild -project wisp.xcodeproj -scheme wisp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build

xcodebuild -project wisp.xcodeproj -scheme wisp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' test
```

### API Keys

Wisp reads optional API keys from gitignored bundled resources. Copy the example files and fill in your own keys:

```bash
cp wisp/Resources/breez-api-key.txt.example wisp/Resources/breez-api-key.txt
cp wisp/Resources/giphy-api-key.txt.example wisp/Resources/giphy-api-key.txt
```

Wisp will build and run without these — you'll just lose Spark wallet support and the Giphy GIF picker, respectively.

### Adding New Files

The project mixes two file-management styles. Files dropped into `wisp/`, `wispTests/`, or `wispUITests/` are auto-included via Xcode's synchronized folders. **Files at the repo root must be added to `wisp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` explicitly** — otherwise they won't compile into the target.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Wisp is open source and community help makes it better.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `refactor/…`, `docs/…`, `chore/…`, `perf/…`)
3. **Make your changes** — follow the existing code patterns and conventions
4. **Test** on a simulator or real device
5. **Commit** with a clear, descriptive message (`<type>: <summary>`)
6. **Open a pull request** against `main` — one concern per PR, small and focused

### Code Conventions

- **Swift + SwiftUI** with the Observation framework — no UIKit screens, no Combine
- **NIP implementations** go in `NipXX.swift` as static helper functions on a `Nip*` namespace
- **Events** are signed via `NostrEvent.sign(...)`, which calls `Schnorr.sign` under the hood
- **Hex** uses the `Hex` helpers; bech32 lives in `Bech32.swift`
- **Concurrency** — view models are `@MainActor`; storage is `actor`-isolated; CPU-bound work runs on detached tasks
- **State** — `@Observable` for view models, plain `let` constants where possible. No `ObservableObject`/`@Published`
- **Keep functions small and focused.** Prefer clarity over cleverness.

### Areas Where Help is Needed

- UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)
- Additional NIP implementations (NIP-23 long-form, NIP-11, NIP-56 reporting…)
- Incoming-event signature verification in the relay pipeline
- iPad and visionOS layout refinements
- Unit and integration tests
- Performance profiling
- Translations and localization
- Documentation improvements

### Reporting Issues

[Open an issue](../../issues) with:

- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Device, iOS version, and Xcode version
- Relevant logs (Console.app filtered to the app)
